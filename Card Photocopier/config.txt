#This is a little bit technical. It's not easy to detect when we can stop reading new lines so what we do is that if we detect an X number of empty lines in a row we suppose we reached the end of the document. We recommend a value of 20 and if it's lower it will finish way faster but it might not reach your villain's cards if they are at the end of your .ods document.
maxEmptyRowsToEnd: 20

#Here you can alter the order depending the types. Cards of the same type will be ordered by name respective to each other, and cards of an unlisted type will be last by name. To make use of the default order recommended by me, write something like "cardTypeOrder: Hero, Condition, Effect, Ally, Item" (without quotation marks). To make it order by name, remove this value entirely.
cardTypeOrder: Hero, Condition, Effect, Ally, Item

#The quality of the resulting images. Put "1" for the best quality but large image, "0" for the poorest quality (horrible trust me) and smallest image possible. Recommended is "0.9" so keep it that way unless you need the file to be even smaller.
imageQuality: 0.9

#If true, apart from generating the images, it will take the N column of the .ods document of each card and create a JSON that the Card Descriptions Loader can read in TTS in order to apply each description to each card.
